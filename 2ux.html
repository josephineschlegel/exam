    <p class="dataInfo">The purpose of the Data Collection assignment was to gain a clear understanding of the different methods one may collect data in future circumstances, which proved to be very important later in the course. Feedback from others really helped me throughout the first semester. Some of the data collection methods that we practiced during this theme I continue to use, for example interviews. The interview gave me an intermate understanding of how the subject thinks and feels towards being interviewed. The fact that I conducted this with one of my good friends gave a vastly different result regarding how the question were answered. When trying to interview someone I didn’t know as well later on the course, I observed there were vast differences in not only their body language, but also answers. It appeared that my friends were more honest with their responses rather than the acquittances are, which has provided something to think about when choosing who to interview next time.
    </p>
    <p class="dataInfo">
        We also practiced desk research, observational research and surveys. I found that I gained the least knowledge from observational research, perhaps because I didn’t get a concrete data, yet due to this exercise I understand the importance of observational research in some circumstances, for example I found that the general public would look at their phones if they were more relaxed, but if stressed for time they would be looking for the bus. Desk research and surveys also proved very useful for gathering information of what the general public want and believe.
    </p>
    <p class="dataInfo">
        In this assignment we were asked to present our findings and analyse the information. Whilst creating the document I was under the impression that each method had to be on one page each, whilst trying to add analysis on each page, resulting in a document filled with too much text and not enough analysis. For future assignments, I will create a separate page where I thoroughly analysis the information in question.

    <p class="dataInfo">The purpose of this assignment was to learn the basics of copywriting. Our assignment in hand was to copywrite a recipe from my home country. I chose to copy write a recipe of Yorkshire puddings and used what I had previous learnt through data collection to conduct an interview with one of my class mates to figure out his eating habits, in order to know what I should focus the recipe on (for example, whether I should focus on time or how much food costs).
    </p>
    <p class="dataInfo">
        During this assignment we were also introduced to card soring, site maps and concept maps. Whilst reviewing this document I see that my understanding of the importance of a concept map has developed much throughout the first semester.

    <img class="styletile" id="style" src="imgs/styletile.png" alt="StyleTilePortfolio">
    <p class="dataInfo">For our prototype, we worked in a group of three and had some issues with teamwork, which we later resolved during the project. On the first day we agreed we wanted to focus on creating a housing website for students coming to Copenhagen, stylising it in a professional manor as our sender was the Danish Ministry of Education. Adrian created the style tile for this, using a 13-point grid for our website layout.

    </div>
    <p class="dataInfo">In order to get some feedback on our idea regarding how to create a functional student housing website, we created a low fidelity prototype which included the main features we thought necessary to include. After creating this we tested it on some other classmates and recorded the process. During this we learnt that there was not a need for as many different pages, along with some major flaws, for example not being able to return to the home page from the inbox. This shaped how we would change our High-Fidelity Prototype. </p>

    </div>
    <p class="dataInfo">We created the High-Fidelity Prototype using Adobe XD with the goal in mind that we wanted to adhere to both feedback from the low fidelity and style tile, since we had based the style tile on the Ministry’s website. The finished prototype shows some issues still, it seemed as the design of the website improved its functionality decreased. This I believe was due to bad teamwork and time management. </p>

    <p class="dataInfo">As mentioned, we struggled with this team dynamic. We were three strong personalities who needed to learn to take time to listen to each other rather than pitch new ideas constantly. Later on, in the semester we learnt how to avoid problems such as these by giving team roles and even out the jobs in question. For this assignment in particular, we divided tasks by category. Adrian was in charge of the style tile, Alex in charge of the prototype and I the documentation. This proved to be a challenge when the deadline came closer and Alex was having technical issues with the high-fidelity prototype, resulting in Adrian taking over. For next time I decided it was necessary to divide tasks evenly and meet group deadlines. </p>

    <p class="dataInfo">In the basic UX theme, we learnt many different methods of obtaining user opinions and expectations, also how to plan design aspects and conceptualize ideas. For the design sprint our group were dedicated to trying to do many of those as possible. Firstly, we started with the mapping and team canvas, whilst giving individuals specific roles to avoid any disagreement. Along with discussing the possible negative outcomes, we knew that the biggest challenge for this assignment was to meet the induvial deadlines of each day as we didn’t have long to complete the task in hand, therefore we took advantage to having many group members and divided the tasks equally so each one of us played a small part. This proved to help in working dynamic a lot and although there were some issues throughout, it was a significant change than the last time, I believe this was due to team roles.</p>
    <p class="dataInfo">
        To get an understanding of what students at KEA wanted, we conducted interviews with some students in the semesters above who are involved with student activities. After discussing that we strived to all agree on what idea we were going to go with. We did this by using different group methods, including lightning demos, the four-step sketch and action steps and votes. This proved to be a really good method to use as everyone had a say in what idea he or she liked the most, as well as giving light to everyone’s ideas. The idea with the most supervotes in turn got chosen, where we then proceeded to create a low fidelity prototype based on our style tile.

    <p class="dataInfo">For our final prototype, we designed an android application for KEA students to meet one another for social activities. We took inspiration from kea frontier app to create the logo and app preview, so it was obvious to the user which apps were related to KEA. Our goal was to redesign our low fidelity to make something really functional with a good user experience. One of the ways we strived to get a good user experience was by adding the clock for setting the time, yet its purpose didn’t look as good as anticipated, next time we will try to tweak some of the design aspects. If you wish to read more about why we chose to design this prototype in this way, please refer back to the previous design sprint documentation.  </p>
