    <p class="dataInfo">In this theme we learnt how to work with a client in mind. After meeting with the client, Foodsharing Copenhagen and hearing their ideas and concerns regarding food waste, all team members had the common goal of highlighting the value of food and how much effort it takes to get to the supermarket in the first place. Another thing we wanted to incorporate was animation because we all enjoyed learning about it in the Basic Animation theme. Therefore, we took inspiration from some videos we had previously seen of fruit with an animated face on it, to create something the receiver could properly empathise for. </p>

    <p class="dataInfo">In this assignment we were required to write a treatment of what we were going to base our video on. This proved difficult for me to do as I had troubles not making it into a whole storyboard however, my teacher Keld, explained me what I did wrong and I managed to re-write it properly. </p>

    <p class="dataInfo">In this theme we made our first pitch to an actual client. We practiced this by having just 30 minutes to prepare beforehand and presented our preliminary pitch to the rest of the Multimedia students the day before to get a feel for what the pitch would be like. After we completed this we were given feedback from both our fellow students and our teachers, allowing us to polish and improve the final result. I was satisfied with how we presented our campaign to the client in the end, they also mentioned that they enjoyed the amount of factual information we included to stress the urgency.  </p>

    <h1 class="foodTitlestwo">FoodSharing Copenhagen Social Media Video</h1>
    <img class="fscVideoAS" alt="GifOfVideoPreview" src="./imgs/fscvad.gif">
    <p class="dataInfo">
    One of the client’s requests was to have a social media video that would entice viewers to the campaign. We believed that because of the cuteness of the apple and seeing it wave with the Foodsharing Copenhagen logo, the viewers would like to know more about it and the apple. The issue with this was that the client didn’t see that as working. Next time we would perhaps add some text explaining more about the campaign in itself.  </p>

    <p class="dataInfo">As our goal was to highlight the importance of food miles and the journey it goes on, we used stock footage to show the process of an apple moving from one side of the world to the other, just to end up in the trash, until Foodsharing Copenhagen arrive and change the outcome. My job in this project was to edit the video whilst Andrei created the After Effects animations for me. The client mentioned he liked the video, however there was missing the climax. He mentioned it felt as if it kept building to something and it didn’t focus enough on the negative cause, in this case being sent to the landfill. If I were to edit this now, I would have the whole process of the apple in the supermarket where he is getting progressively sadder and change the song to one longer, so it doesn’t feel as rushed. </p>
