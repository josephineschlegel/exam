    <p class="dataInfo">In Basic Animation theme, we began character development and designing characters on Adobe Illustrator. This theme sparks a lot of creative thinking for me and gave me freedom to explore visionary story ideas. For this project I used some of my favourite TV shows as inspiration to create my Illustrator character. I particularly enjoyed creating the background of this assignment, as it involved more trees.  </p>

    <h1 class="spriteTitles">Sprite Animation on a Background</h1>
    <img class="spriteBack" alt="ImageOfCharacterAnimation" src="./imgs/aniscreen.png">
    <p class="dataInfo">For this assignment, we were required to create a sprite animation on our own Illustrator background. At this point I began to regret designing such a complex character, as I not only had to move the characters face and body, but also wings. It proved a challenge for me to ensure that everything was moving smoothly, which you can see on the movement of the character hips. I also had issues setting the character in the canter of the div, causing her feet to come out of the bottom of the screen. Luckily, I managed to learn how to fix that when it came to JavaScript controlled animation.  </p>

    <h1 class="projectTitles">JavaScript controlled animation</h1>
    <img class="aniGIF" alt="ImageOfCharacterAnimation" src="./imgs/javascriptgif.gif">

     <p class="dataInfo">I faced many issues with getting JavaScript to work properly for this assignment, I had tried to copy the code online without truly understanding how JavaScript works. My assignment was not approved due to only two of the buttons were actually working. Therefore, I did some self-studying on how to use JavaScript properly and managed to fix the issues at stake. Although pleased with the result, I would like to learn how to create CSS animations with the character still moving, in this case; flapping her wings.  </p>

    <p class="dataInfo">As I was unable to attend class that day due to illness, I did this project at home individually. This project helped me learn more of how JavaScript worked, along with being an enjoyable task. I chose to create the drums, using the same styling and sounds as given on the example.  </p>

    <p class="dataInfo">As I was unable to attend class that day due to illness, I did this project at home individually. I learnt from Project Pool 1 that we could be more creative with what we based this project on, therefore I chose one of my favourite TV shows the Simpsons to add a comical side to the example, Smack the Fly.  </p>

    <p class="dataInfo">For this assignment, we took on team roles that we had previously learnt about in the Basix UX theme, along with creating a team canvas and mapping out ideas. Our goal for our game was to create an educational, but user friendly, welcoming game for students thinking of moving to Copenhagen. We had an illustrator character explain the different steps one must complete after moving, as we all agreed that it wasn’t clear for us personally once we had moved. The team dynamic was much better in this group than any before, as we had all experienced what not to do at this point. </p>

    <p class="dataInfo">In order to promote our Onboarding game, I created a GIF using Illustrator and Photoshop of our character inside a Danish flag. I decided to have the “help” text blink twice to further entice the users attention towards playing the game. </p>

    <p class="dataInfo">For our Onboarding game, we were vastly stressed for time. Unfortunately, all my other team members fell ill during this week, therefore we didn’t have much meeting around what we could change or how to do it. As we mostly communicated through text, I learnt the importance of team communication and meeting in person, as we largely misunderstood each other at times. My job for this was copywrite all of the text and find the relevant questions and information, along with documentation and presenting the game during the exhibition. The game shows some issues that we didn’t have time to resolve, for example the fact that once you click on an item to showcase the information, you must click on the item again to go to the next page and get rid of the speech bubble, it would’ve been a better user experience if they had the option to click anywhere. Also, the design of the quiz at the end could’ve been stylized and designed better. We also received feedback from users that the text was too long and there was too much information.  </p>
