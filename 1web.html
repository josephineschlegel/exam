    <p class="webinfo1">To start our basic web design, we were given an art style and learnt the fundamental principles of photoshop. In the intro week we had created our Persona Collage where we gained some experience using photoshop, making it easier to apply to the Mood Board. For the Mood Board itself, I decided to try to include some classic paintings in the style of Bauhaus to inspire some inspiration whilst creating my first responsive website. I placed all my chosen keywords into the basic shapes of Bauhaus, as I knew that I wished to style my website around these simplistic shapes. During creating this mood Board, I learnt a lot about Bauhaus and the principles behind it. Overall, I’m pleased with the result of this however, if I were to create this project again, I would make sure to refer back to my original Mood Board, as the finishing result did not adhere much to it. </p>

    <p class="webinfo2">Here I present my Bauhaus Documentation. I collected this information to gain some background knowledge of Bauhaus, learning that it was an art movement that stripped all complexity regarding art and bringing it back to simple shapes and primary colours. During my research, I also learnt about some important architects and artists that stood for the Bauhaus momentum, however looking back on the documentation I see that I provided very little information about them. The reason I did this was I also strived to keep the document at simplistic as possible, in the style of Bauhaus, although I feel I should’ve provided some more information. In the document, you also find some planning for how I was going to present my first responsive website, all confiding to the classic Bauhaus style. Looking back at my File Structure, I see that I needed some more experience in organising how to store and name my documents, as it is not optimal for HTML and creates more files than necessary.</p>

    <h1 class="projectTitles"> Responsive Website: First Attempt</h1>
    <p class="webinfo1">
        In theme 02 Basic Web, we learnt the basic principles of HTML and CSS. We were given an art style that we had to evaluate and base our website on. As this was my first-time coding, I started very roughly, I didn’t have much understanding of the assignment in question, assuming that the website had to look like our given art styles, which in my case was Bauhaus. The idea behind this initial attempt was to keep the classic Bauhaus triangle that I designed on photoshop and have my navigation inside the triangle. As you can see from the slideshow to the right, I tried to adhere to this, however I was deeply unsatisfied by the result. I felt that the website looked childish with a bad user interface and experience. Therefore, I chose to fix this issue by completely starting fresh and do some self-studying about HTML and CSS. The reason as to why I decided to start fresh was because of really not appreciating the initial attempt and a motivation to truly understand coding of the web, this time I understood that the website had not to look like the art style, just be about it. Therefore, I styled the responsive website to something I really enjoyed the look of. </p>

    <p class="webinfo2">Here I present the new documentation of the re-try of the first responsive web. As mentioned, I decided to completely change the design elements of my initial attempt, as I was not found of both the user experience and interface. As we were required to create a logo using illustrator, I chose to create “Schlegel Productions”, looking back I’d liked to have had created a more original name, as I feel using my last name was a fall-back on my lack of creativity at the given time. My goal of this project was to create something that was aesthetically pleasing to me personally, I did this by creating a XD prototype of the layout of the website, which included my illustrated logos and icons. Although I changed the finishing result of the responsive website, I kept some of the core ideas from my XD prototype, for example the colour scheme and fonts. The reason as to why I change the finishing result towards the prototype being that after conducting a trunk test, I got some oral feedback on how to design the website better. One of the main factors being that the burger icon should only be shown if it’s on mobile version, therefore causing me to create a horizontal navigation bar. <a href=http://schlegelj.com/productiondoc target="_blank" class="firstweblink">Click here to visit my second process document.</a></p>

    <h1 class="projectTitles"> Responsive Website: Second Attempt</h1>
    <p class="webinfo1">
        The updated version shows vast differences than the first attempt. Something I struggled with when creating the first prototype was having the nav bar taking up too much space on the mobile view. I knew that the navigation bar should be accessible at all times, however once set to sticky it would take up to around 40% of screen view, making it more of a bother than anything else. Therefore, in the updated version I when with a classic horizontal navigation bar. The theme changed to like colours and marble texture, along with some starts animation on loading. I chose to include the stars animation was coded onto the whole screen, however, is only visible to users on the darker colours, which made it visible only on the nav and the logo homepage. If I were to change anything about my second responsive website, I would create a burger icon using media queries and I would create the animation only to be on the induvial DIV’s of nav bar and the logo image. Another design aspect that I’m not overly satisfied about was the use of coloured textboxes on a coloured background, because since then I have learnt that simplicity is key when designing a website.
