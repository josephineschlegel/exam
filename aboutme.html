    <p class="myinfo"><img class="mepic" id="zoompic" src="./imgs/metree.png" alt="PicOfMe">My name is Josephine Jellesen Schlegel, I’m 21 years old Dane raised in the South of England. I moved to Denmark for the first time when I was 14 years old so I could attend Danish boarding school and get closer to my roots. Although boarding school was difficult at times, I’m very happy I ended up going, as I actually passed my International baccalaureate, resulting in being able to move to Copenhagen. Copenhagen is probably my favourite city ever, as I enjoy that it’s not too busy and the streets look nice with good architecture. Since moving to Copenhagen I’ve bought an apartment and the cutest Munchkin Cat there is, got into university and have the best friends I could ask for. My cat is a big part of my happiness, along with travelling. I try my best to travel as much as possible, my favourite place to go being Cape Town. Alongside that I really enjoy everything to do with makeup, special effects being something I’m mostly interested in. For work I bartend at the Little Green Door, a Japanese cocktail bar with one of my best friends and roommate for a manager, let’s see how that goes. Lastly, I really like trees. I always said if I were to get a tattoo, I would get a tree on my ankle, however I’m too much of a coward to go through with it, hence why I based my portfolio around branches.
